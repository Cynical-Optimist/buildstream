.SH NAME
bst\-shell \- Shell into an element's sandbox environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bst shell
[OPTIONS] ELEMENT [COMMAND]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run a command in the target element's sandbox environment

This will first stage a temporary sysroot for running
the target element, assuming it has already been built
and all required artifacts are in the local cache.

Use the --build option to create a temporary sysroot for
building the element instead.

Use the --sysroot option with an existing failed build
directory or with a checkout of the given target, in order
to use a specific sysroot.

If no COMMAND is specified, the default is to attempt
to run an interactive shell with `sh -i`.
