=================
buildstream 1.0.1
=================

  o Fixed instability of cache keys generated for elements
    using the `local` source

  o Removed some undocumented secret and unused APIs, technically
    a break but nothing yet depends on these.


=================
buildstream 1.0.0
=================
First stable release of BuildStream

BuildStream 1.0.0 is all about API stability - for the past months we
have been reviewing our various API surfaces, implementing strategies
for revisioning of our interfaces and cleaning up. Long term stability
is very important for build reproducibility over time, and this release
is the first promise we are making on any API surfaces.

Stable API surfaces include:
  o The command line interface
  o The YAML user configuration file format
  o The YAML project `.bst` file format
  o The core Python module imported by external plugins
